## Analysing Gate hits
Geant4 steps can be logged in terminal with sim.g4_verbose, sim.g4_verbose_level_tracking = True, 1 (EventIDs are not logged, hence better do that with small number of events)
- ProcessDefinedStep (Gate) is pre-step, ProcName (G4) is post-step
  => thus when new track are generated in sensor, their ProcessDefinedStep is none.
- KineticEnergy (Gate) is pre-step, KinE (G4) is post-step
- StepLength (Gate) / StepLeng (G4) can be used to match hits (Gate) / steps (G4)
