# Simulate a single layer Compton camera

![Screenshot of a reconstruction](doc/img.png)

- Use Gate10 to simulate a single layer Compton camera
- Optionally add Allpix2 to simulate detector a semiconductor pixel detector response (e.g. Timepix3)
- Reconstruct cones from:
  - Geant4/Gate 'hits'
  - Gate 'singles'
  - Allpix2 'pixel hits' (WIP)
  - measured data (WIP)
- Validate simulation/measurement of gamma point sources
- Reconstruct 3D image with basic back-projection
- Visualize 3D images with napari

Requires:
- python3
- 20 GB of disk space
- Optional: Allpix2, ROOT 6, CUDA

Tested with:
- Ubuntu 22.04 and 24.04
- python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12
- Gate 10.0.1  
- Allpix2 3.1.0
- cupy-cuda115 / cupy-cuda128 and GeForce RTX 2080 Ti

Future work:
- add advanced GPU-based reconstruction algorithms, e.g. CoReSi

## Installation

### 1) Download or clone/checkout: 
```
git clone -b compton-camera-tests https://github.com/tbilloud/GateContrib
```

### 2) Create a virtual environment
```
cd GateContrib/imaging/ComptonCamera_tests/Gate10
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3) Install required python packages
`pip install -r requirements.txt`  

To use the GPU-based functions (point source validation, reconstruction), install CUDA and the Cupy package suited to your CUDA version, e.g.  
`pip install cupy-cuda115`

### 4) Optional: Install Allpix2

Install BOOST:
```
sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
```

Install Eigen3:
```
sudo apt-get install libeigen3-dev
```

Install and source ROOT 6:  
https://root.cern/install/  
```
wget https://root.cern/download/root_v6.32.10.Linux-ubuntu22.04-x86_64-gcc11.4.tar.gz
tar -xzvf root_v6.32.10.Linux-ubuntu22.04-x86_64-gcc11.4.tar.gz
source root/bin/thisroot.sh
```

Then install Allpix2 without Geant4:  
https://allpix-squared.docs.cern.ch/docs/02_installation/  
```
cd allpix
git clone https://gitlab.cern.ch/allpix-squared/allpix-squared
rm -rf .git # remove the git folder to avoid conflicts
cd allpix-squared
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install-noG4 -DBUILD_GeometryBuilderGeant4=OFF -DBUILD_DepositionCosmics=OFF -DBUILD_DepositionGeant4=OFF -DBUILD_DepositionGenerator=OFF -DBUILD_GDMLOutputWriter=OFF -DBUILD_VisualizationGeant4=OFF ..
make -j4
make install
```


### 5) Set environment
```
export GLIBC_TUNABLES=glibc.rtld.optional_static_tls=2000000
```

## Getting started
Run the test:  
`python3 main.py`  
The 1st time you run a simulation, Gate10 will install Geant4 datasets, which can take a while. This is done only once.

In main.py, the 1st part (code until block 'ANALYSIS AND RECONSTRUCTION') is the Gate 10 simulation. See user manual:  
https://opengate-python.readthedocs.io/en/master/user_guide/user_guide_intro.html

Then, several functions are available. Step-by-step:
1) Print basic info about Gate output files 
- Gate hits with analyze_hits(). Gate hits are like Geant4 hits and are different from pixel hits.
- singles, which are group of hits per pixel, with analyze_singles()
2) Simulate pixel hits:
- from Gate singles with gSingles2pixelHits()
- from Allpix2 output with gHits2allpix2pixelHits()
3) Reconsutruct cones:
- from Gate4 hits with gHits2cones_byEvtID()
- from pixel hits (WIP)
4) Check cones from a point sources:
- validate_psource() plots cone projections. It's slow, ~1 sec per cone.
- with GPU acceleration with validate_psource_gpu()
5) Reconstruct 3D image:
- with backprojection with backprojection(). It's slow, ~1 sec per cone.
- with GPU acceleration with backprojection_gpu()

### QT issues with Gate 10.0.1
When using Qt-based code (e.g. napari) after simulation, the main.py script might fail with:
```
WARNING: QObject::moveToThread: Current thread (0x57ad941535d0) is not the object's thread (0x57ad94c1ef50).
Cannot move to target thread (0x57ad941535d0)
...
```

Solution:
```
mv /path-to-virtual-environment/lib/python3.XX/site-packages/opengate_core/plugins /path-to-virtual-environment/lib/python3.XX/site-packages/opengate_core/plugins.bak`
```
Replace XX with your python version, e.g. 10

## Allpix2

Allpix2 is a C++ software for precise simulation of semiconductor pixel detectors.
It simulates the transport of charge carriers in semiconductor sensors and their signal induction.
It is used primarily for detector R&D in particle physics.  
https://cern.ch/allpix-squared


Allpix2 can read the hits root file from Gate.
Combined with Gate10, the entire simulation can be done with a single python file, using the function
gHits2allpix2pixelHits() after the sim.run() in the main.py script. It does the following:
1) run Gate10 and creates the hits root file
2) generate the three .conf files needed by Allpix2
3) run Allpix2 and creates the output files data.txt and modules.root in the sub-folder 'allpix'
4) read data.txt and return a pandas dataframe with the pixel hits

An Allpix2 simulation needs 3 configuration (.conf) files:
- detector geometry
- detector model
- simulation parameters

The main configuration file (simulation parameters) is a 'simulation chain' made of several components:
- global parameters
- electric field
- charge deposition
- charge propagation
- charge transfer
- digitization
https://allpix-squared.docs.cern.ch/docs/03_getting_started/06_simulation_chain/

For each component, several modules are available.
- Charge propagation:
  - ProjectionPropagation: fast but only silicon sensors, linear electric field, one carrier type at a time
  - GenericPropagation
  - TransientPropagation
- Charge transfer:
  - SimpleTransfer: no ToA (as of v3.1.0, 2025-01-08)
  - CapacitiveTransfer
  - PulseTransfer
  - InducedTransfer
- Digitization:
  - DefaultDigitizer
  - CSADigitizer
